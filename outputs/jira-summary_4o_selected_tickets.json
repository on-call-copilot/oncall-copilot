    "issue": "The Noyo transaction for Delfino AI, Inc was blocked despite the plan being mapped, due to an error indicating a missing Noyo plan mapping.",
    "issue_summary": "The issue was that the Noyo transaction was blocked because the system could not find a matching Noyo plan mapping for the Rippling plan, even though the plan was confirmed to be mapped correctly.",
    "rca": "The root cause of the issue was that the Noyo system did not have the 'Employee Only' version of the plan on file, which led to the transaction being blocked.",
    "steps_taken": "The affected plan was unmapped and remapped in the Noyo plan mapper, and the transaction was retried. It was identified that the Noyo system lacked the 'Employee Only' plan version, and further troubleshooting with Noyo was planned.",
