    "steps_taken": "The resolution involved several steps:\n1. Correcting the company rules to add the correct billing group to employees' carrier_config.\n2. Removing the incorrect billing_group from the NoyoPlan mapping.\n3. Resending Noyo snapshots for the company after corrections.\n\n```python\n# Example code snippet for removing billing group\nremove_billing_group_from_noyo_plan_mapping(billing_group_id='10001')\n# Code to resend snapshots\nresend_noyo_snapshots(company_id='652862b55aae5fb69de97be2')\n```\n",

    "issue_summary": "New hire enrollments for Anvyl Technologies are failing to transmit to the carrier through Noyo due to incorrect or missing plan mapping information for the specified plan.",
    "rca": "The root cause of the issue is that the Noyo plan mapping information for the 'Anthem Gold PPO 3000/0%/3000 w/HSA' plan is either incorrect or missing. This is further complicated by the presence of discontinued plans in the Noyo system that need to be updated.",
    "steps_taken": "The resolution involved deleting the incorrect mapping for the discontinued plan and recreating the mappings after confirmation from Noyo. The specific actions taken included:\n\n```python\nreturn NoyoCompanyPlanInfo.objects.filter(company_plan_info=\"670d62f711546c06c4c69b8d\", id=\"671b4fe2f804eeade0dfe0d2\").delete()\n```\n\nThis code snippet was used to delete the incorrect mapping directly from the database.",

    "steps_taken": "The solution involved clearing all discontinued plans in Noyo that were still mapped in Rippling. This was done using a script to delete mappings for discontinued plans, ensuring that only current and correctly mapped plans remained. \n\n```python\ndced_plans = [x for x in NoyoAPI.get_group_plans(\"c1076e50-8801-470f-a078-9899fc9422ca\") if x[\"status\"] == \"discontinued\"]\nfor dced_plan in dced_plans:\n    print(\"Deleting mappings for discontinued plan\", dced_plan[\"id\"])\n    ncpis = NoyoCompanyPlanInfo.objects.filter(company=company, noyo_plan_id=dced_plan[\"id\"])\n    print(\" Found\", len(ncpis), \"NoyoCompanyPlanInfos\")\n    print(\"  IDs\", [str(x.id) for x in ncpis])\n    print(\"Lines\", [str(x.noyo_line_type) for x in ncpis])\n    if False:\n        ncpis.delete()\nreturn None\n```",
