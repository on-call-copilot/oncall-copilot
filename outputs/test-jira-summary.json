    "issue": "The Noyo transaction for Delfino AI, Inc was blocked due to an error indicating that there was no matching Noyo plan mapping information, despite the plan being mapped correctly in the system.",
    "issue_summary": "The transaction was blocked because the Noyo system did not have the 'Employee Only' version of the plan on file, which led to a mismatch in plan mapping.",
    "rca": "The root cause of the issue was that the Noyo system only had a plan for 'Employee with Dependent', but the employee in question had no dependents. This resulted in a missing plan for the 'Employee Only' tier in Noyo.",
    "steps_taken": "The affected plan was unmapped and remapped in the Noyo Plan Mapper, and the transaction was retried. It was identified that the Noyo system lacked the 'Employee Only' version of the plan, and further troubleshooting with Noyo was planned.",

Verified and confirmed that the bill group 10001 was correct and removed bill mapping from mapped configurations.\n5.

Additionally, there were discontinued plans at Noyo's side that were still mapped with Rippling, conflicting with new Noyo plans. These were cleared from the system, and the tasks did not reopen.",
    "steps_taken": "The issue was resolved by identifying and removing mappings for discontinued Noyo plans. The following code snippet was used to identify and delete these mappings:\n\n```python\ndced_plans = [x for x in NoyoAPI.get_group_plans(\"c1076e50-8801-470f-a078-9899fc9422ca\") if x[\"status\"] == \"discontinued\"]\nfor dced_plan in dced_plans:\n    print(\"Deleting mappings for discontinued plan\", dced_plan[\"id\"])\n    ncpis = NoyoCompanyPlanInfo.objects.filter(company=company, noyo_plan_id=dced_plan[\"id\"])\n    print(\" Found\", len(ncpis), \"NoyoCompanyPlanInfos\")\n    print(\"  IDs\", [str(x.id) for x in ncpis])\n    print(\"Lines\", [str(x.noyo_line_type) for x in ncpis])\n    if False:\n        ncpis.delete()\nreturn None\n```\n\nAdditionally, the affected Noyo plans were unmapped from billing group '0000', and the tasks were marked as resolved.
