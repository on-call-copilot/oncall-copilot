    "key": "BENINTEG-2627",
    "summary": "In the BENINTEG-2627 ticket, the issue was identified when OneKonnect received unintended plan terminations for TaskRabbit in the production file dated 10/29/2024. These terminations were for the current plan year, despite TaskRabbit having completed their insurance renewal and open enrollment early for the 1/1/2025 renewal. This led to incorrect 'benefitterminationdate' data being sent to OneKonnect, flagged by the carrier due to tolerance checks. The problem was caused by a logic error in handling special cases where early renewals should not trigger terminations for the ongoing plan year."

    "key": "BENINTEG-2626",
    "summary": "The issue in ticket BENINTEG-2626 involves incorrect rounding of benefit amounts for Basic Life and AD&D coverages, where amounts are not rounding up to the nearest $1,000 as expected per the account structure. This discrepancy was identified through an example where an employee's salary of $136,500 was not rounded to $137,000. The root cause is linked to a deliberate code change made in September 2023, where additional rounding was removed when sending volume to Ideon, as per a past decision documented in a Jira ticket and a GitHub merge request.",

    "summary": "The issue involves stopping the automated schedules for production files for a list of clients who have started their Open Enrollment (OE) period. This action is necessary to prevent the transmission of outdated or incorrect data during the sensitive OE period. The clients listed are associated with either Cigna or UHC and have specific deadlines by which the automated processes need to be halted."

    "summary": "The issue in ticket BENINTEG-2622 involves incorrect plan terminations being sent to OneKonnect for Astra Space Operations in the production file dated 10/29/2024. These terminations were for the current plan year, despite the customer having completed their insurance renewal and open enrollment for the 1/1/2025 renewal early. This error was flagged by the carrier due to their tolerance checks. The root cause is related to the logic handling special cases, which needed review and optimization to prevent high-impact errors in future renewals."

    "key": "BENINTEG-2621",
    "summary": "Lisa, an employee at Quince, was receiving email notifications from Rippling despite not being listed as a third-party benefits administrator. The issue was traced back to her email being incorrectly added under the carrier transmission tab, which led to her receiving these notifications. This was rectified, and her email was removed from the tab on October 26th, which should have stopped the notifications."

    "summary": "The issue involves a group admin reporting a missed Qualified Life Event (QLE) for a newborn, which was not properly processed in Rippling and needs to be amended and pushed to Noyo. The newborn was born on 9/1 but was only added to Rippling on 9/30. The root cause category is related to 'Noyo' under the subcategory 'Visibility', indicating issues with data visibility or processing between Rippling and Noyo."

This error occurred despite the system functioning correctly for two weeks prior. The root cause analysis indicates that no further action was required, suggesting that the issue might have been transient or resolved through other means."

    "summary": "The issue in ticket BENINTEG-2617 involves an employee, Faraz Shaikh, who added his spouse to medical, dental, and vision coverage following a qualifying life event (QLE) on 10/03/2024. However, the medical enrollment for his spouse, Nabeeha Mahmood, was not being pulled into the production file, although dental and vision enrollments were correctly included. Additionally, the spouse's record was incorrectly positioned at the end of the file feed rather than immediately following the employee's record. The root cause analysis did not definitively determine why the medical enrollment was initially omitted or why the spouse's record was misplaced in the file feed, but the issue was temporarily resolved by regenerating the pending action."

    "key": "BENINTEG-2616",
    "summary": "The issue in ticket BENINTEG-2616 involves unexpected form submissions for three member level transactions at Hometap Equity Partners LLC, despite the Noyo EDI feed for BCBS MA coverage being in production since 10/21. The transactions should have been processed through the EDI feed, but were instead sent via form. Troubleshooting confirmed the EDI feed setup was correct and the carrier received the first production file successfully. The issue might be related to plan mapping tasks that were not automatically resolved due to being outdated."

    "summary": "The issue in ticket BENINTEG-2615 involves a failure to generate a COBRA Cancellation form for an employee, which was expected to be automatically created upon the completion of the COBRA Cancellation event. This failure led to significant financial implications as the employee was terminated, but the insurance carrier did not receive the cancellation form and continued the coverage, leading to unnecessary costs. The root cause was identified as a bug in the system that had been previously fixed, but the fix did not retroactively apply to events prior to the patch."

The request was to add an email to be cc'd on Anthem forms for a specific client, Gorjana. However, the system only allows admin emails to be added, not non-role specific emails, leading to the request being unfeasible under current system constraints."

The correct email address should be Phoenix_Service@metlifeservice.com. The group is unable to make this change themselves as they are setting up their EDI connection, necessitating an interim solution to update the email address for form sending. The root cause is identified as the need to add an email while the carrier connection is being set up."
