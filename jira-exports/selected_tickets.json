For example, you will see that plan 30cc5fa9-1793-4e54-9705-315c3798f057 (VSP - Choice Full Feature in Plan Mapper Page) is correctly mapped to just {{benefit_class_identifier}} 0003. I also pushed an amendment for an employee enrolling in plan f1b9f356-2902-4455-9fcc-c7fcf9eef762 (DENTAL DG7- TX in Plan Mapper Page) and did not receive any error messages, so there does not appear to be any plan mapping issues. As such, it is unclear why these tasks are generating when everything has already been set up correctly. \n\n*Account and EE Details*\n\nCompany ID: 64398590b924acd5d92b7ba4\n\nCountry: USA\n\nARR: $126,480.45\n\nEntity Name: Transcend Privacy Inc.\n\nName & Role IDs of affected employee(s) / admin(s), if applicable - N/A, group level issue \n\nEscalated client: No\n\nPEO Customer: No\n\n*Troubleshooting actions taken so far*: \n\n# Referred to guidance in [this runbook|https://rippling.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCE/pages/2892007035/Base+Noyo+Setup+Task+Walkthrough#4.-Configuration-Assignment] for actioning these task types\n# Confirmed that all plans are mapped to the correct classifications in the Noyo Plan Mapper page \n# Pushed amendment for EE 656f7e89be01d92c2ef8d1f9 and did not receive any error messages. \n\n*Action required from Eng*: Please research why these tasks generated even though everything appears to be correctly set up already. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or clarification in order to research further.
