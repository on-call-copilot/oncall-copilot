Debugger Error: 
Unable to find a matching Noyo plan mapping information. Please collaborate with the INS Ops team to verify or update Noyo plan mappings for the Ripping plan: Beam SmartPremium Plus 100/80/50/50-1500-1500, line type: dental. Error details: Object type: <class ‘insurance.models.noyo_models.NoyoCompanyPlanInfo'>, queried_with : {'company_id': '637545f1a3a2c9c8f4adef54', 'noyo_group_id': 'a2c66c38-8b0f-43c2-9e13-c252e881754b', 'company_plan_info_id': '6764b3a105f0976360c64f15', 'company_plan_info_plan_name': 'Beam SmartPremium Plus 100/80/50/50-1500-1500', 'member_type': 'employee', 'line_type': 'dental', 'classification_values': '{}', 'carrier': 'Beam'}

Ops Troubleshooting: 
Verified connection information matches between company debugger page and noyo cc, checked for old mapped plans, checked individual enrollments in noyo to confirm no beam enrollment information has sent. 

Ask: 
Will you look into why the plans aren’t populating in the plan mapper for the group, and add the Beam plans for mapping?
